# **Pubzero AI**

Welcome to the **Pubzero AI** project! This open-source initiative aims to build a suite of **AI-driven agents** and **tools** to accelerate various parts of the game development pipeline. Pubzero AI is designed to assist indie game developers by automating key tasks such as procedural content generation, game design, bug fixing, and NPC behavior. By leveraging AI, the goal is to make game development faster, more efficient, and accessible.

## **Overview**

**Pubzero AI** is an open-source collection of AI-driven tools built to assist indie game developers throughout the game development pipeline. From automating the creation of assets, balancing game mechanics, debugging code, to handling NPC behaviors, **Pubzero AI** aims to streamline and enhance the game development process.

The tools are designed to integrate with popular game engines like **Unity**, **Unreal Engine**, and **Godot**, enabling developers to focus on creativity while the AI tools handle repetitive and complex tasks.

---

## **Features**

* **AI Game Design Assistant**: Automatically balance game difficulty, progression, and mechanics.
* **Procedural Content Generation**: Generate 3D models, environments, and game levels using AI.
* **NPC Behavior AI**: Create adaptive NPCs that respond to player actions dynamically.
* **Bug Detection & Fixing**: Identify and fix bugs or performance issues in game code using AI.
* **AI-Powered Game Trailer Generation**: Automatically generate game trailers from gameplay footage.
* **Web3 Integration**: Tools to integrate NFTs and decentralized economies into your game (optional).

---

## **Technologies**

**Pubzero AI** uses a combination of the following technologies:

* **AI & ML**: Reinforcement learning, neural networks, GPT-based models for procedural generation and game mechanics optimization.
* **Game Engines**: Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot.
* **Web3 (Optional)**: Integration with blockchain technologies like Ethereum and stablecoins for Web3 game economies.
* **Programming Languages**: JavaScript, Python, C# (depending on the specific tool or module).
* **AI Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenAI GPT, and others for various AI applications.

## **Setup**

Follow these steps to set up the **Pubzero AI** project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js** (for backend tools and web-based modules)

   * [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

2. **Python** (for AI/ML tools)

   * [Install Python](https://www.python.org/)

3. **Unity / Unreal Engine** (for game engine integration)

   * [Install Unity](https://unity.com/)
   * [Install Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/)

4. **Git** (for cloning the repository)

   * [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pubzero-ai.git
cd pubzero-ai
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies for the project:

For **Node.js** (backend or web tools):

```bash
npm install
```

For **Python-based tools** (for AI/ML):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting Up Game Engines

* For **Unity** or **Unreal Engine**, follow their official setup guides to configure your environment for integration with **Pubzero AI**.
* Ensure you have access to **assets** or **dependencies** required for integration.

## **Usage**

Once you've set up the repository and installed dependencies, you can start using the AI tools.

### Running the AI Game Design Assistant

```bash
# For backend (Node.js)
npm run start

# For AI-based features (Python)
python run_game_design_assistant.py
```

### Running the AI Bug Detection

For bug detection, run the AI tool to analyze your game code:

```bash
# Bug detection in code (JavaScript)
node src/bugFixer/bugDetectorAI.js path/to/your/game/code
```

### NPC Behavior AI

To implement adaptive NPC behaviors, use the `npcBehaviorAI.js` script:

```bash
node src/npcBehavior/npcAI.js --input game_level.json --output npc_behavior.json
```
